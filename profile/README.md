## 🌐 Welcome to Solinode

**Open-source cloud, automation, and beyond — built for flexibility and freedom.**

> rebranding underway  

Solinode is a developer-led organization building tools to decentralize and democratize infrastructure. We believe the future of the cloud is *open*, *self-hosted*, and *in your control*.

Whether it’s deploying compute to your own hardware, spinning up reliable local networking, or automating secure edge services — we’re here to make powerful infrastructure more accessible.
